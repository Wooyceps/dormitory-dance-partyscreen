			<h1>What is disco - dormball?</h1>
			<p>Disco dormball is a website designed for dormitory dance- houseparty purposes. It comes in handy whenever You want to bring some life to a party, where people dance in a small room.</p>
			<p>What it does is really really simple - it shines colorfull light from your screen. In company with good music it makes your little indoor danceoff to a whole new level. To make sure that lights match current vibe, you can either use predefined theme colorways - or create custom ones. </p>
			<p>By adjusting the rapidness of color changes, tones and timers it can make your party feel like clubhouse, rave, techno, concert or whatever you desire - have fun. Cheers!</p>
